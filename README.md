# Krtkus

An extended 5x12 keyboard with 61 total keys. PCB is designed in Kicad, case in Blender.

## Parts

- 61 choc switches
- 61 SMT diodes
- Arduino Pro Micro

My initial assembly cost turned out to be $380 total, half of which was shipping. But the case and PCB alone should be around $30 to manufacture.
