# Krtkus

An extended 5x12 keyboard with 2 extra keys. The design is intended for ortho layouts with an offset number row, allowing for the placement of the delete and tilde keys above their usual spots.

PCB is designed in Kicad, case in Blender.

## Parts

- Arduino Pro Micro
- 61 Choc V1 switches
- 61 SMD diodes

My assembly cost turned out to be $380 total, half of which was shipping. The PCB and case alone was around $30 to manufacture.
