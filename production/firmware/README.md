# Firmware

Here you can find pre-compiled atmega32u4 firmware files, intended for the Pro Micro controller.

Most Pro Micros should run caterina, however if you encounter issues, you might want to try another bootloader, like `atmel-dfu`.

The legacy firmware is only used for a specific version of the KS-33 PCB, which is no longer publicly available.
