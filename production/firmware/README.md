# Firmware

Here you can find pre-compiled atmega32u4 firmware files, intended for the Pro Micro controller.

Most Pro Micros should run caterina, however if you encounter issues with bootloading, the atmel-dfu version might work better.

The legacy firmware is only used for a specific legacy version of the KS-33 PCB.
